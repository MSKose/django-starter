# settings.py configuration

ðŸ’¡ NOTE: this Django repo is opinionated in that it comes with `drf_yasg` (a 3rd party swagger package) and `django-debug-toolbar` already installed and configured. See the notes on those [here](https://github.com/MSKose/django-notes/blob/master/Django%20Fundamentals/django-settings-starter/README.md). Also, sqlite for dev and postgresql for prod settings was chosen. Therefore, after cloning this repository, keep those in mind and change the parts to your linking.
